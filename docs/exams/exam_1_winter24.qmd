```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false

deaths_df <- rio::import("https://byuistats.github.io/timeseries/data/traffic_deaths.xlsx")

deaths_tibble <- deaths_df |>
  mutate(
    date_str = paste("1", Month, Year),
    dates = dmy(date_str),
    year = lubridate::year(dates),
    month = lubridate::month(dates),
    value = Deaths
  ) |>
  dplyr::select(dates, year, month, value)  |> 
  tibble()

# Create the index variable and convert to a tsibble
deaths_ts <- deaths_tibble |>
  mutate(index = tsibble::yearmonth(dates)) |>
  as_tsibble(index = index) |>
  dplyr::select(index, dates, year, month, value) |>
  rename(deaths = value) # rename value to emphasize data context

# Compute the additive decomposition for deaths_ts
