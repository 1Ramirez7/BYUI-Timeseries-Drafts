## Question 3 (30 points)

![Decomposition 1](https://github.com/byuistats/timeseries/raw/master/exams/exam1/test1_winter24_decomp1.png){#fig-3}

![Decomposition 2](https://github.com/byuistats/timeseries/raw/master/exams/exam1/test1_winter24_decomp2.png){#fig-4}

@fig-3 and @fig-4 represent either the additive or multiplicative decompositions of the same time series.

#### A) Which of these figures is the additive decomposition? Justify your answer (10 points)

<!-- Delete this and put your answer here. The three colons mark the end of your answer. -->
:::

#### b) Which of the decompositions is more appropriate for the time series? Please justify your position. *Hint: Decompose an additive series using the wrong algorithm. Then decompose a multiplicative series using the wrong algorithm.* (20 points)
