<summary>Define autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models</summary>
-   Write the equation for an ARMA(p,q) model 
-   Express an ARMA model in terms of the backward shift operators for the AR and MA components
-   State facts about ARMA processes related to stationarity, invertibility, special cases, parsimony, and parameter redundancy
-   Use ACF and PACF plots to determine if an AR, MA or ARMA model is appropriate for a time series

<summary>Apply an iterative time series modeling process</summary>
-   Fit a regression model to capture trend and seasonality
-   Examine residual diagnostic plots to assess autocorrelation 
-   Fit an ARMA model to the residuals if needed
-   Check the residuals of the ARMA model for white noise
-   Forecast the original series by combining the regression and ARMA model forecasts
