<summary>Implement the Holt-Winter method to forecast time series</summary>

-   Compute the Holt-Winters estimate by hand
-   Use HoltWinters() to forecast additive model time series
-   Plot the Holt-Winters decomposition of a time series (see Fig 3.10)
-   Plot the Holt-Winters fitted values versus the original time series (see Fig 3.11)
-   Superimpose plots of the Holt-Winters predictions with the time series realizations (see Fig 3.13)
