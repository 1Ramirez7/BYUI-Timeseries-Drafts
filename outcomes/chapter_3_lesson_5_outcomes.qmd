<summary>Implement the Holt-Winter method to forecast time series</summary>

-   Explain the Holt-Winters method equations for multiplicative decomposition models
-   Explain the purpose of the paramters $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$
-   Interpret the coefficient estimates $a_t$, $b_t$, and $s_t$ of the Holt-Winters smoothing algorithm
-   Explain the Holt-Winters forecasting equation for multiplicative decomposition models, Equation (3.23)
-   Use HoltWinters() to forecast multiplicative model time series
-   Plot the Holt-Winters decomposition of a TS (see Fig 3.10)
-   Plot the Holt-Winters fitted values versus the original time series (see Fig 3.11)
-   Superimpose plots of the Holt-Winters predictions with the time series realizations (see Fig 3.13)
