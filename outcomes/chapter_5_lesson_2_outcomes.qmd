<!-- 3.   	Check adequacy of fitted regression models using residual diagnostics (Analyzing) -->
<!-- a.        Examine residual autocorrelation to check for omitted dynamics -->
<!-- b.   	Review residual plots to check appropriateness of linearity assumptions -->
<!-- 4.   	Modify regression models to account for non-constant variance and autocorrelated errors (Applying) -->
<!-- a.        Apply transformations like logs to stabilize non-constant variance -->
<!-- b.   	Use generalized least squares to correct standard errors for autocorrelation -->
<!-- 5.   	Apply data transformations like logs to stabilize variance prior to regression (Applying) -->
<!-- a.        Take logarithms to stabilize exponentially increasing variances -->
<!-- b.   	Apply inverse transforms and bias corrections when forecasting from log models -->
