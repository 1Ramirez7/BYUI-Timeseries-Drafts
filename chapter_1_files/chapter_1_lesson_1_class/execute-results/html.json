The month with the highest number of searches has a value of 100. The values for the other months are given as a percentage of the peak month's value. The following table illustrates the data, as given by Google Trends.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n                                     \n Category: All categories            \n                                     \n Month     chocolate: (United States)\n 2004-01                           36\n 2004-02                           45\n 2004-03                           29\n 2004-04                           32\n 2004-05                           29\n 2004-06                           26\n 2004-07                           27\n 2004-08                           27\n 2004-09                           29\n 2004-10                           33\n 2004-11                           46\n 2004-12                           67\n 2005-01                           40\n    ⋮                               ⋮\n 2023-10                           57\n 2023-11                           69\n 2023-12                          100\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe cleaned version of the data used for this demonstration are available in the file <a href=\"../data/chocolate.csv\" download>chocolate.csv</a>.\n\nIn Lesson 3, we will practice converting data like this into a time series (tsibble) object.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show the code\"}\nif (!require(\"pacman\")) install.packages(\"pacman\")\npacman::p_load(\"tsibble\", \"fable\",\n               \"feasts\", \"tsibbledata\",\n               \"fable.prophet\", \"tidyverse\",\n               \"patchwork\", \"rio\")\n\n# read in the data from a csv and make the tsibble\n# change the line below to include your file path\nchocolate_month <- rio::import(\"../data/chocolate.csv\")\nstart_date <- lubridate::ymd(\"2004-01-01\")\ndate_seq <- seq(start_date,\n                start_date + months(nrow(chocolate_month)-1),\n                by = \"1 months\")\nchocolate_tibble <- tibble(\n  dates = date_seq,\n  year = lubridate::year(date_seq),\n  month = lubridate::month(date_seq),\n  value = dplyr::pull(chocolate_month, chocolate)\n)\nchocolate_month_ts <- chocolate_tibble |>\n  mutate(index = tsibble::yearmonth(dates)) |>\n  as_tsibble(index = index)\n\nchocolate_month_ts |> head()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tsibble: 6 x 5 [1M]\n  dates       year month value    index\n  <date>     <dbl> <dbl> <int>    <mth>\n1 2004-01-01  2004     1    36 2004 Jan\n2 2004-02-01  2004     2    45 2004 Feb\n3 2004-03-01  2004     3    29 2004 Mar\n4 2004-04-01  2004     4    32 2004 Apr\n5 2004-05-01  2004     5    29 2004 May\n6 2004-06-01  2004     6    26 2004 Jun\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFor now, we will use the tsibble object (which in this case is called *chocolate_month_ts*) to explore the time series.

Given the value from December, is the value in the following February independent and completely random?\n-   The value reported by Google for June 2023 is 53. Based on what you have observed in the data, do you think the value for July 2023 will be close to or far from this value?
