## Class Activity: White Noise (5 min)

### Definition

In this class, we are learning to investigate different types of time series. Up to this point, we have focused mostly on time series with distinct seasonal behavior. We will not focus on what are called *stochastic processes* or random processes, where there is not necessarily a seasonal component. We first focus on **white noise**.

<!-- Check Your Understanding -->

::: {.callout-tip icon=false title="Check Your Understanding"}

-   Based on your understanding from the reading, explain the concept of white noise to your partner.
-   Can you give an example of a time series that would represent white noise?

:::

A time series $\{w_t: t = 1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ is a **discrete white noise (DWN)** if the variables $w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n$ are independent and identically distributed with mean 0. The assumption that the variables are identically distributed implies that there is a common variance denoted $\sigma$. The assumption of independence means that the covariance (and correlation) between different variables will be zero: $\cov(w_i, w_j) = 0$ and $\cor(w_i, w_j) = 0$ if $i \ne j$. 

If the variables are normally distributed, i.e. $w_i \sim N(0,\sigma^2)$, the DWN is called a Gaussian white noise process. The normal distribution is also called the Gaussian distribution, after Carl Friedrich Gauss.


### Simulation

The following simulation illustrates a white noise time series.

### Visualizing White Noise 

The data in the file [white_noise.parquet](https://byuistats.github.io/timeseries/data/white_noise.parquet) were generated by a Gaussian white noise process.

```{r}
#| echo: false

# Create white noise data file

# Set random seed
set.seed(10)

# Specify means and standard deviation
n <- 2500                           # number of points
white_noise_sigma <- rnorm(1,5,1)   # standard deviation

# Simulate normal data
data.frame(x = rnorm(n, 0, white_noise_sigma)) |>
  rio::export("data/white_noise.parquet")
```

```{r}
# White noise data
white_noise_df <- rio::import("https://byuistats.github.io/timeseries/data/white_noise.parquet")
```

The first 250 points in this time series are illustrated here:

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

white_noise_df |> 
  mutate(t = 1:nrow(white_noise_df)) |>
  head(250) |>  
  ggplot(aes(x = t, y = x)) + 
    geom_line() +
    theme_bw() +
    labs(
      x = "Time",
      y = "Values",
      title = "First 250 Values of a Gaussian White Noise Time Series"
    ) +
    theme(
      plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)
    )
```

Here is a histogram of the `r nrow(white_noise_df)` values from this DWN distribution.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
white_noise_df |>
  mutate(density = dnorm(x, mean(white_noise_df$x), sd(white_noise_df$x))) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = x)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(density)),
        color = "white", fill = "#56B4E9", binwidth = 1) +
    geom_line(aes(x = x, y = density)) +
    theme_bw() +
    labs(
      x = "Values",
      y = "Frequency",
      title = "Histogram of Values from a Gaussian White Noise Process"
    ) +
    theme(
      plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)
    )
```

Notice that the values follow a normal distribution. This suggests the data are from a Gaussian white noise distribution.


### Fitting the White Noise Model

Since the mean of a DWN time series is zero, the only parameter we need to fit is the variance.

::: {.callout-tip icon=false title="Check Your Understanding"}

-   Compute the sample variance for the DWN data given above.

:::


### Second-Order Properties

When we refer to the second-order properties of a time series, we are talking about its variance and covariance. The mean is a first-order property, the covariance is a second-order property.

::: {.callout-note label="Second-Order Properties of a Discrete White Noise Process}
If $\{w_t\}_{t=1}^n$ is a DWN time series, then

$$ \mu_w = 0 $$
and
$$
  cov(w_t, w_{t+k}) = 
    \begin{cases}
      \sigma^2, & k = 0 \\
      0,        & k \ne 0
    \end{cases}
$$
