## Class Activity: Random Walks (15 min)

### Definitions

Consider moving on a number line, where your movements are determined by a discrete white noise (DWN) process. Each successive value indicates how far you will move along the number line from your current position. This is mathematically equivalent to allowing your position at time $t$ to be the sum of all the observed DWN values up to time $t$.

::: {.callout-note title="Definition of a Random Walk"}

Let $\{x_t\}$ be a time series. Then, $\{x_t\}$ is a **random walk** if it can be expressed as
$$
  x_{t} = x_{t-1} + w_{t}
$$
where $\{w_t\}$ is a white noise series.

:::

There are other ways to represent this expression.

<!-- Check Your Understanding -->

::: {.callout-tip icon=false title="Check Your Understanding"}

-   Notice that $x_{t-1} = x_{t-2} + w_{t-1}$ and x_{t-2} = x_{t-3} + w_{t-2}. Use this to explain why it is possible to write $x_t$ as
    $$
      x_{t} = w_{t} + w_{t-1} + w_{t-2} + \cdot + w_2 + w_1
    $$
    where $w_1$ is the first observation of the DWN time series.
    
:::

This process of *back substitution* is so common, we define notation to handle it.

::: {.callout-note title="Definition of the Backward Shift Operator"}

We define the **backward shift operator** or the **lag operator**, $\mathbf{B}$, as:
$$
  \mathbf{B} x_t = x_{t-1}
$$
where $\{x_t\}$ is any time series.

We can apply this operator repeatedly. We will use exponential notation to indicate this.

$$
  \mathbf{B}^2 x_t = \mathbf{B} \mathbf{B} x_t = \mathbf{B} \left( \mathbf{B} x_t \right) x_t = \mathbf{B} x_{t-1} = \mathbf{B} x_{t-2}
$$

In general, 
$$
  \mathbf{B}^n x_t = \underbrace{\mathbf{B} \cdot \mathbf{B} \cdot \cdots \cdot \mathbf{B}}_{n ~ \text{terms}} x_t = \mathbf{B}^{n-1} \left( \mathbf{B} x_t \right) = \mathbf{B}^{n-1} \left( x_{t-1} \right) = \mathbf{B}^{n-2} \left( x_{t-2} \right) = \cdots = \mathbf{B} x_{t-(n-1)} = x_{t-n}
$$

:::

We will practice applying this operator.

<!-- Check Your Understanding -->

::: {.callout-tip icon=false title="Check Your Understanding"}

Let $\{x_t\}$ be a time series with the following values. 

```{r, results='asis'}
#| echo: false

set.seed(6)
n <- 8
d_operator <- data.frame(t = c(1:n), x = sample(1:15, n, replace = FALSE)) |>
  mutate(diff = t - n)
cat( paste( paste0("$x_{t", ifelse(d_operator$t==n,"",d_operator$t-n), "} = ", d_operator$x, "$"), collapse = ",$~$ " ) ) 

d_value <- function(power_on_d = 0) {
  out <- d_operator |> #### Note the use of this global variable
    filter(diff == -power_on_d) |>
    dplyr::select(x) |>
    pull()
  
  return(out)
}

# `r d_value(0)` - 4 (`r d_value(1)`) - 2 (`r d_value(2)`) + 5 (`r d_value(3)`) = 
# `r d_value(0) - 4 * *d_value(1) - 2 * d_value(2) + 5 * d_value(0)`
```

Evaluate the following. 

-   $\mathbf{B} x_t$
-   $\mathbf{B}^4 x_t$
-   $\left(\mathbf{B}^4 - \mathbf{B} \right) x_t$
-   $\left( \mathbf{B}^2 - 6 \mathbf{B} + 9 \right) x_t$
-   $\left( (\mathbf{B} - 6 )\mathbf{B} + 9 \right) x_t$
-   $\left( \mathbf{B} - 3 \right)^2 x_t$
-   $\left( 1 - \frac{1}{2} B - \frac{1}{4} B^2 - \frac{1}{8} B^3 \right) x_t$

### Second-Order Properties

The second-order properties of a random walk are summarized below. 

::: {.callout-note title="Second-Order Properties of a Random Walk"}
If $\{x_t\}_{t=1}^n$ is a random walk, then the population has the following properties. 

$$ \mu_x = 0 $$
and
$$
  cov(x_t, x_{t+k}) = t \sigma^2
$$
Note that the covariance of the process depends on $t$. The covariance depends on $t$, so random walks are non-stationary. The variance is unbounded as $t$ increases. That means a random walk will not provide good predictions in the long term.

If $k>0$, the correlation function is therefore

$$
  \rho_k 
  = 
    \frac{
            cov(x_t, x_{t+k})
          }{
            \sqrt{var(x_t)} \sqrt{var(x_{t+k})}
          }
  =
    \frac{t \sigma^2}{\sqrt{t \sigma^2} \sqrt{(t+k) \sigma^2}}
  =
    \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\frac{k}{t}}}
$$

:::

Note that if $0 < k \gg t$, then $rho_k \approx 1$. Because of this, a correlogram for a random walk will typically demonstrate positive autocorrelations that start near 1 and slowly decrease as $k$ increases.

### The Difference Operator

Computing the difference between successive terms of a random walk leads to a discrete white noise series. In many cases, differencing sequential terms of a non-stationary process can lead to a stationary process of differences.



# Working above here...this stuff below was copied from the first part of 4-1.

Note that the properties given above are theoretical properties of the population, not estimates computed using a sample. The sample autocorrelations will not equal zero, due to randomness inherent in sampling.

In your introductory statistics course, you learned about Type I error.

::: {.callout-note title="Type I Errors"}

Suppose we will conduct a hypothesis test with a level of significance equal to $\alpha = 0.05$. If the null hypothesis is true, due to sampling variation there is a probability of 0.05 that we will reject the null hypothesis...even though it is true. We refer to this as making a **Type I Error**. 

:::

When we create a correlogram, we actually conduct one hypothesis test for each value of $k$. With so many hypothesis tests, it is not surprising if some of them show a significant correlation due to chance alone. In this case, we tend to disregard correlations that are barely significant and inexplicable.


### Fitting the White Noise Model

Typically, a DWN series arises in the random component of another time series. If we have fully explained the level and seasonality in the time series, then the only component left is the random component, which would ideally follow a DWN process.

Since the mean of a DWN time series is zero, the only parameter we need to fit is the variance.
