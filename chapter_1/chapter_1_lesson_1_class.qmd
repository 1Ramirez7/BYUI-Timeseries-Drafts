## Class Activity: Introduction to Time Series Data (15 mins)

-   What is time series data?
-   Examples of time series data
-   Why ordinary regression fails -- correlated error terms
-   Define "time series" (e.g. observations collected sequentially over time)
-   Examples of time series from different domains:
    -   Daily credit card balance
    -   Daily closing stock prices
    -   Monthly sales figures
    -   Yearly global temperature measurements
    -   Secondly wave heights in an ocean buoy
    -   Weekly unemployment rates
    -   Quarterly GDP estimates
-   Importance of context and subject matter knowledge
-   Role of models (explanation, prediction, simulation)
-   Introduce key features: trend, seasonality, autocorrelation

::: callout-caution
Please add an R chunk to illustrate the decomposition of a time series. For example, the Google Trends data for a search for one of these words:

-   Love
-   Marriage
-   Morals
-   Jesus
-   Latter-day Saints (Start at Jan 1, 2010; Note the breakpoint in October 2018, when President Nelson gave the talk, "The Correct Name of the Church.")
-   Depression
-   Virtue
-   General Conference
:::

-   Vocabulary terms (Identify each in the example above):
    -   Time series analysis
    -   Time series
    -   Sampling interval
    -   Serial dependence or autocorrelation
    -   Time series trend
    -   Seasonal variation
    -   Cycle
    -   Deterministic vs. Stochastic

::: callout-caution
This needs to be shifted to another lesson. There is not enough time here. \## Random walks (5-10 mins)

```         
-   Definition of a random walk
-   Example: tossing a coin and moving left or right one integer on a number line
-   Please add simulation of random walk here
```
:::

## Recap (5 mins)

-   Review objectives and key concepts
-   Clarify questions on course or time series data

## Preparation for the next class meeting

-   Update R and RStudio
-   Access the Time Series Notebook (Quarto file)
-   Purchase the textbook
-   Read Chapter 1
-   Create a reading journal
-   Prepare to share your reading journal with another student in the next class meeting
